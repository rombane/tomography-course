    "# Landweber iteration and discrepancy principle\n",
    "In this lab, you should solve a three-dimensional tomography problem with the Landweber method. Have a look at the lecture slides to see how these things work. Here are some general hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with a three-dimensional Sheppâ€“Logan phantom and use a small $32 \\times 32 \\times 32$ resolution for testing. Make sure that the images are centered at the origin. Use about $10$ angles, otherwise you will not see the effect of semi-convergence.\n",
    "* Create the sinogram with a [cone beam geometry](http://odlgroup.github.io/odl/generated/odl.tomo.geometry.conebeam.cone_beam_geometry.html#odl.tomo.geometry.conebeam.cone_beam_geometry) and add some noise to the sinogram. For the discrepancy, you will need the noise nevel $\\| g - g_{\\mathrm{noisy}}\\|$ of the sinogram $g$. (In real applications, you must estimate this value, but let us keep this example simple.)\n",
    "* You get the norm of a vector with its norm method.\n",
    "* You can get the transpose of the forward operator with the function [odl.tomo.RayBackProjection](http://odlgroup.github.io/odl/generated/odl.tomo.operators.ray_trafo.RayBackProjection.html).\n",
    "* You can obtain an estimate of the largest singular value of the forward operator with its [norm method](http://odlgroup.github.io/odl/generated/odl.operator.operator.Operator.norm.html).\n",
    "* Start the iteration with the zero vector.\n",
    "* Do about $200$ iterations.\n",
    "* While doing the reconstruction, check if the discrepancy criterion is satisfied (but do not stop the iteration).\n",
    "* Plot the relative error of your reconstruction depending on the number of iterations."
